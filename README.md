# Cordova Media Plugin Duration Demo
Ionic app demonstrating the use of the new duration update callback for cordova-plugin-media

This demo is built with the Ionic framework.

## Testing on iOS

```
$ npm i -g ionic cordova
$ npm i // local dependencies
$ ionic cordova emulate ios
```

**Note:** The iOS build will likely fail as you will need to open the project and select a development team.  After doing so, re-run `$ ionic cordova build ios`.

## Testing on Android

```
$ npm i -g ionic cordova
$ npm i // local dependencies
$ ionic cordova emulate android
```

**Note:** You may need to have the android emulator started before it will properly attach to the emulator.
